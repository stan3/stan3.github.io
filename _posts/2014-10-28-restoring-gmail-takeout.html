title: Restoring Gmail Takeout
---
<p>Recently I wanted to merge an old gmail account with my main one. The best
way to achieve this seems to be by taking a Takeout of the Gmail data and
restoring into the other account. IMAP to IMAP seemed to be more time consuming
and suffer from not dealing with Gmail labels properly.</p>
<p>After some while searching for options I can across the following tools</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gaubert/gmvault">https://github.com/gaubert/gmvault</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gburca/BaGoMa">https://github.com/gburca/BaGoMa</a></li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/jay0lee/got-your-back/">https://github.com/jay0lee/got-your-back/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>From these only the last seemed capable of <a href="https://github.com/jay0lee/got-your-back/wiki#action_restorembox">restoring
the Takeout's mbox file</a>. I extracted the Takeout's all.mbox to
~/Downloads/gmail and then ran the script.</p>
<pre>
python gyb.py --email my@gmail.com --action restore-mbox --local-folder ~/Downloads/gmail
</pre>
