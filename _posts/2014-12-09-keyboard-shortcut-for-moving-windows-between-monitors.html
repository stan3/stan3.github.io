title: Keyboard shortcut for moving windows between monitors
---

    <p>Unity (as of Ubuntu 14.10) does not come with a keyboard shortcut to move
windows between screens. There is a Compiz plugin that does though - put. To
enable</p>
<pre>
sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager compiz-plugins
</pre>
<p>Then go into ccsm and set a shortcut for &quot;Put to Next Output&quot; (I used Super
and N) in the Put options within the Window Management section.</p>
