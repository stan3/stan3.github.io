title: Musings on Docker and Open Source Software
---

    <p>I've been keen on containers, particularly over virtual machines, ever since
experimenting with OpenVZ. No extra OS fits with a nothing left to take away
philosophy. Now it seems to have taken over the virtual machine on the cloud
buzz. About time. Still, is it where we want to head?</p>
<p>A Docker talk I recently saw (it was also interesting that he ran a Ubuntu
VM on a Mac) had a nice comparison with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containerization">containerization</a> of
shipping in the 1950s. Nice. But how does it compare to the Open Source world
where I have a distribution like Debian or Ubuntu which packages all its
software and releases every so often. Aren't packages my container? Maybe not
from a security perspective but then I have AppArmor to think about too. It
appears Docker is better built for a heterogeneous environments since my
packages aare distro specific. But I'm not sure I want to accept heterogeneity,
if I have a choice?</p>
