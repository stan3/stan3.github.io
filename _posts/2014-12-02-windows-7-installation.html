title: Windows 7 installation :/
---

    <p>I'm reinstalling Windows on my laptop as part of selling it. Process turns
out to be relatively easy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download correct language iso - google for DigitalRiver Windows 7 iso</li>
<li>Format a USB drive as NTFS with bootable flag set (possible in the Ubuntu
Disks utility</li>
<li>Copy content of ISO to the drive (sudo mount -o loop
~/Downloads/X17-59186.iso /mnt)</li>
<li>Boot laptop off the USB drive</li>
</ol>
