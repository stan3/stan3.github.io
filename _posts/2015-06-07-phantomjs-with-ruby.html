title: PhantomJS with Ruby
---

    <p>I've just been experimenting with a couple of ways of using <a href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a> because of the speed benefits.</p>
<p>Option 1 is the poltergeist capybara driver, using with the <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/phantomjs/">phantomjs gem</a></p>
<pre>
Capybara.register_driver :poltergeist do |app|
  Capybara::Poltergeist::Driver.new(app, :phantomjs =&gt; Phantomjs.path, phantomjs_options: ['--proxy=http://localhost:9889'])
end
</pre>
<p>The next one was a bit trickier to work out:</p>
<pre>
Selenium::WebDriver::PhantomJS.path = Phantomjs.path
Capybara.register_driver :selenium do |app|
  Capybara::Selenium::Driver.new(app, :browser =&gt; :phantomjs)
end
Capybara.default_driver = :selenium
</pre>
<p>Both work well. I had a problem with javascript alert() and confirm() on
both, as in verifying what the alert says. There are bugs open for these. There
is also capybara webkit that I have not tried.</p>
